A suite of climbing-related apps.

## partner finder
As a climber, it can be frustrating to find partners whose goals align with your own. There isn't one archetypal "climber." People climb for many reasons, including recreation, competition, exercise, solitude, and adventure. There are also many different types of climbing. This fact makes it difficult to find a partner that shares similar goals and ambitions.

What's more, climbing is a passion that can involve inherent risks. This makes it not only convenient but sometimes essential to align yourself with others who take safety as seriously as you do.

Partner Finder aims to help climbers find partners who share similar goals, styles, and attitudes toward their shared passion. In addition, it hopes to provide a means to verify that a particular user meets certain criteria before being "vouched for" by the app. Users can award badges to other users. These badges serve as votes of confidence attesting to another user's, say, ability to provide a safe belay. Or their ambition to climb a certain grade. Or their ability to safely climb multi-pitch rock routes. Or their desire to complete certain training goals. Or even their desire to take find a mentor or take on a mentee.

Through the use of badges from other app users, users can earn an attestation from the app itself. As a user, you will then be able to filter by any number of criteria to find a climber who, for example, lives in the Mountain West, climbs at least 5.10, has their own trad climbing gear, and takes safety seriously.
