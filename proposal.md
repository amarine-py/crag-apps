# Alex Marine -- Capstone Proposal: Crag Apps -- Partner Finder

Crag Apps aims to be a suite of climbing-related web applications. Each individual app solves a separate problem. The overall bundle will bee called "Crag Apps." I am only focusing on ONE of the individual apps for this capstone project. That individual app is called (as of now) Partner Finder.

## 1. Problem Statement

As a climber, it can be quite difficult to find partners whose goals align with your own. There isn't one archetypal "climber." People climb for many reasons, including recreation, competition, exercise, solitude, and adventure. There are also many different types of climbing. This fact makes it difficult to find a partner that shares similar goals and ambitions. 

What's more, climbing is a passion that can involve inherent risks. This makes it not only convenient but sometimes essential to align yourself with others who take safety as seriously as you do. 

Partner Finder aims to help climbers find partners who share similar goals, styles, and attitudes toward their shared passion. In addition, it hopes to provide a means to verify that a particular user meets certain criteria before being "vouched for" by the app. Users can award badges to other users. These badges serve as votes of confidence attesting to another user's, say, ability to provide a safe belay. Or their ambition to climb a certain grade. Or their ability to safely climb multi-pitch rock routes. Or their desire to complete certain training goals. Or even their desire to take find a mentor or take on a mentee.

Through the use of badges from other app users, users can earn an attestation from the app itself. As a user, you will then be able to filter by any number of criteria to find a climber who, for example, lives in the Mountain West, climbs at least 5.10, has their own trad climbing gear, and takes safety seriously.

## 2. Technical Solution

Create an application that allows its users to seek out other climbers based on certain criteria. These criteria take two forms: badges that are awarded by other users (social component) and volunteered profile information (self-assessment component).

### Scenario 1

Corbin is visiting his daughter at college in Chicago. He wants to be able to boulder while he is there and is aware that there is a great bouldering gym in the neighborhood he is staying. He can use Partner Finder to search for partners that meet his desired criteria. He filters by: safety level, seriousness, climbing ability, and location. Corbin is able to find a few partners who are looking to climb with others who take safety very seriously, are laid-back and not too serious or pretentious about climbing, climb in the V3/V4 grade range, and regularly boulder at his target gym. After exchanging messages with a few of these partners, Corbin finds someone who can meet up and show him around the gym for a few hours while his daughter is in class.

### Scenario 2

Alex is interviewing for a full-stack developer job in Flagstaff, AZ. While he is in town, he decides to take a few extra days to get some multi-pitch alpine climbing in. He uses Partner Finder to search for potential partners in the area who possess at least six years of experience, are able and willing to climb a two-day objective, in alpine style, in the 5.11 difficulty range, with tolerance for moderate risk scenarios. He finds 10 other users in the area who claim to possess all of these criteria in their self-assessments, but only two of them have been awarded badges by other users that back up these claims. He decides to message the two partners with badges, as he doesn't want to take anyone's word for their level of experience and safety given the seriousness of the objective. Partner Finder, through its badging system, vouches that at least X number of other users have awarded these two climbers badges testifying to their safety and experience levels. He can also look at the profiles of the users who have awarded these badges to make sure that they themselves have adequate experience to allow for sound judgement. Alex can now feel secure in the assumption that the candidate partners have been awarded the badges in good faith.

### Scenario 3

Sarah is a beginner climber with 2 years of experience. She has climbed outdoors, but only on top rope. She wants to take the next step and start leading moderate sport routes. She would like to find a partner with more experience who is willing to take on a mentee, to some degree. Sarah uses Partner Finder to find another woman, Sophie, of similar age who has eight years of outdoor leading experience and is willing to climb with beginners. As an added bonus, Sarah sees that Sophie also has a 70-meter rope and 20 sport draws. Sarah messages Sophie and they agree to climb in the gym for a session before taking a one-day trip to their local outdoor crag to inaugurate their new partnership.

## 3. Glossary

## User/Climber

A person who holds a profile on Partner Finder and who has completed their self-assessment survey.

## Badge (still being fleshed out)

A "plaudit" or "token" awarded to a user by another user. This badge takes the form of an icon and attests to the fact that the user who awarded the badge "vouches" for the user in whatever category relates to the badge. For example, badge categories may include: "expert belayer", "attentive spotter", "5 Years Experience", "sport lead climber", "trad follower", etc.

A user will only have a certain number of badges to award in a given time period. These details still need to be worked out.

## Certification (still being fleshed out)

A user will be "certified" by Partner Finder in a given area if they receive a certain number of badges by users who meet a certain experience level. The algorithm for this has not yet been developed.
